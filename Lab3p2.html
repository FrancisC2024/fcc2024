<p>One of the most important things I learned about creating usable Web Pages was the use of Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) to enhance the look of my web page. CSS adds visual flare to your web page and makes styling a web page a much easier process. CSS is essential to making the Web page organized and have a presentation that stands out in comparison to other we pages. The three different type of CSS, Inline, Embedded and External, are all used for distinct purposes and give you mulitple options for how you can write code for the design of your web page. </p>
<p>Another set of usful HTML tools I learned to use in creating a usable web page are Images, Lists and hyperlinks. By using the img tag you can add any gif, jpeg and jpg that you need for any section on a web page.Images can be edited via the width and height attributes. Hyperlinks allow you to add links to separate web pages and are an important element in making a funcitional web page. The list tag is a very usful tool in creating either ordereded or unordered lists for a web page and I utilized  the ul tag to create the list of main ideas for this web page. Each of these tags all help to formulate a well structured and unique web page.</p>
<p>Javascript is another useful tool in creating a web page. Javascript adds the elements of conditions, functions and objects to your web page coding. Setting a condition for user inputs adds a new element to your web page allowing you to code alerts for when a user meets specific condition.Functions are a set of commands that will play out based on the user input. Objects are functions and data that act based on the parameters set by the coder and will change based on the user input. Both Objects and Functions improve user experience on a web page. Overall Javascript expands how the user interacts with your web page and is a fundamental element in the creation of more complex web pages.  </p>
