<h1>Critique 1</h1>
<h3>Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">https://www.reddit.com/</a></h3>
<p>I think reddit's web page is designed pretty well for what its used for. Reddit has high search engine visibility so you can search for specific content that you are looking for or information on a topic you are looking for.The site is very user friendly and does not really violate design conventions established by other sites Something thst reddit is used for and is really good at is answering user questions.</p>
<h1>Critique 2</h1>
<h3>Twitch <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/">https://www.twitch.tv/</a></h3>
<p>I personally am not very fond of most streaming sites especially twitch. An issue in the top ten list that I identified with twitch is its page titles have low serach visibility especially with the large amount of creators and categories on the platform. Another issue is theat it can open new browser windows which can be annoying. Something that I appreciate is the fact that twitch has many differing font sizes making the site scannable. </p>
<h1>Critique 3</h1>
<h2>Indeed <a href = "https://www.indeed.com/">https://www.indeed.com/</a> </h2>
<p>Indeed is a site I am using currently and one that I will continue to use in the future. Indeed has a feature that is important in web desgin which is visited links change colors. Another thing that I liked was the fact that searching jobs on the site does not have to be overly literal making it more usable. An issue I found is how indeed design wise looks like an ad but when put in xontext with the purpose of the website it makes sense.</p>
<h1>Critique 4</h1>
<h2>Twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/">https://twitter.com/</a></h2>
<p> The people you find on twitter is the reason I just overall don't really like this site. An design flaw that I noticed was an overly literal search engine when looking for tweets or topics. Another issue I found was that it does not really follow common design conventions for most sites I have seen. One thing I will give the design credit on is the text being scannable and easy to read.</p>
